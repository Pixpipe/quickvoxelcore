## Quickvoxel Core

![][61]

**Quickvoxel Core** is a pure Javascript toolkit for volumetric visualization of neuro files in the web browser. Everything that happens in Quickvoxel is strictly client-side, without the need of an active server (i.e. can run on a Github page)

Features:

-   Open and decodes **NIfTI**, **MINC2**, and **MGH** (experimental)
-   Display volume in world/subject coordinates to align registered volumes
-   **Obliques**
-   Can **blend** two volumes with different methods
-   Apply **colormaps**  ([44 available][62])
-   Adjust **contrast** and **brightness**

Requirement:

-   A modern web browser, compatible with WebGL2 (Chrome is ok for some versions)

Quickvoxel Core is backed by [Pixpipe][63] for decoding volume files and process the data, and by [BabylonJS][64] for the WebGL2 rendering.

Since this project is a **core only**, it is not bound to any frontend framework and needs to be sugar coated with some UI elements to provide a proper user interaction. You can find a minimal 10-lines example [here][65] ([source][66]).  
A lot of additional methods to do more interesting things with _Quickvoxel_ are implemented in the core and need to be tied to UI element to be fully usable. We'll see that in the following part.

# Install

Since **Quickvoxel Core** will most likely be used as a dependency, it can be used in multiple ways:

**From a simple HTML page:**

```html
<!-- ES6 version -->
<script src="quickvoxelcore/dist/quickvoxelcore.es6.js"></script>

<!-- or ES5 version -->
<script src="quickvoxelcore/dist/quickvoxelcore.js"></script>

<!-- or ES5 minified version -->
<script src="quickvoxelcore/dist/quickvoxelcore.min.js"></script>
```

**From another ES module:**

```bash
npm install quickvoxelcore --save
```

Then, from your module:

```javascript
// import the ES5 version
import quickvoxelcore from 'quickvoxelcore'

// or import the ES6 version
import quickvoxelcore from 'quickvoxelcore/dist/quickvoxelcore.es6.js'
```

# How To

## Getting started

To start, _QuickvoxelCore_ needs an HTML5 canvas element:

```html
<html>
<head>
  <title>QuickvoxelCore Test</title>

  <style>
  body {
    overflow: hidden;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    margin: 0;
  }

  #renderCanvas {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
  </style>

</head>
<body>
  <script src="../dist/quickvoxelcore.es6.js"></script>

  <canvas id="renderCanvas"></canvas>

  <script>
    let canvas = document.getElementById("renderCanvas")
    // ...
  </script>

</body>
</html>
```

No matter the way you pick (simple HTML page or ES module to be bundled), the features are accessible from the `quickvoxelcore` namespace:

```javascript
let canvas = document.getElementById("renderCanvas")

let qvc = new quickvoxelcore.QuickvoxelCore( canvas )
```

The constructor `quickvoxelcore.QuickvoxelCore(...)` initializes several internal objects, two important ones can be fetched: the `VolumeCollection` and the `RenderEngine`:

```javascript
// ...

let qvc = new quickvoxelcore.QuickvoxelCore( canvas )

let volumeCollection = qvc.getVolumeCollection()
let renderEngine = qvc.getRenderEngine()
```

## Interlude: the VolumeCollection

The `VolumeCollection` instance allows you to add new volume from file URL or from a file dialog. Once added, a volume file will automatically:

-   be given a unique ID within the collection
-   be parsed by Pixpipe
-   create a 3D texture for later display

The methods you will use from your `VolumeCollection` instance are:

-   `.addVolumeFromUrl( String )` to add a volume from a URL
-   `.addVolumeFromFile( File)` to add a volume from a file in the local filesystem

In addition, `VolumeCollection` provides some events so that actions can be triggered during the lifecycle of a `Volume`:

-   `volumeAdded` is called when the volume is parsed and added to the collection. But its webGL texture is not ready yet! The callbacks attached to this event will have the volume object as argument.
-   `volumeReady`called after `volumeAdded`, at the moment the added volume has its WegGL 3D texture ready. At this stage, a volume is ready to be displayed.The callbacks attached to this event will have the volume object as argument.
-   `volumeRemoved` is called when a volume is removed from the collection with the method `.removeVolume(id)`. The callbacks attached to this event will have the volume id (string) as argument.
-   `errorAddingVolume` is called when a volume failed to be added with `.addVolumeFromUrl()` and `.addVolumeFromFile()`. The callbacks attached to this event will have the url or the HTML5 File object as argument.

To each event can be attached multiple callbacks, they will simply be called successively in the order the were declared. To associate a callback function to an event, just do:

```javascript
myVolumeCollection.on("volumeReady", function(volume){
    // Do something with this volume
})
```

In general, events are most likely to be defined from the main scope or from where you also have access to the `RenderEngine` instance.

## Interlude: the RenderEngine

The `RenderEngine` instance is in charge of displaying the volume from the collection, once they are loaded. It also comes with all the features to rotates/translates the three orthogonal planes (referred as `_planeSystem` in the source), apply a colormaps, change brightness/contrast and deal with blending.

A `RenderEngine` can display only 2 volumes at the same time. The terminology used in the doc and source is

> Two **slots** are available to **mount** volumes on the render engine. Those slots are called **primary** and **secondary**.

Then, some volume can be _unmounted_ from a given slot and another volume from the volume collection can be _mounted_.

Rendering features such as **colormap**, **contrast** and **brightness** are associated to _slots_ and not to _volumes_. This means, if you use the _primary_ slot to mount a structural MRI and the _secondary_ slot to mount a functional MRI, and then adjust the brightness/contrast/colormap of the secondary slot, mounting another fMRI instead of the one in place will not change those settings.

_Note: there are plans to add a additional volume for masking_

## Mount a volume once it's ready

Here is how to load a volume from a URL (that has to comply with CORS, i.e. be in the same server as Quickvoxel)

```javascript
// ...

volumeCollection.addVolumeFromUrl( "./data/structural.nii.gz" );

// mount the volume when it's ready!
volumeCollection.on("volumeReady", function(volume){
  // to mount the loaded volume on a specific engine slot.
  // (if a volume is already on this slot, it's unmounted and replaced by the new one)
  renderEngine.mountVolumeN( 0, volume )

  // OR, you can just mount it on the first slot available
  let couldMount = renderEngine.mountVolumeOnFirstEmptySlot( volume )

  if( !couldMount ){
    console.log("All volume slots are taken on the render engine, make some space before rendering this volume.");
  }
})
```

Alternatively, a volume can be loaded from you filesystem using a file dialog. Look at the [example here][67]. Then, the logic for mounting on a slot is the same.

## VolumeCollection

The VolumeCollection is automatically initialized by the constructor of QuickVoxelCore.
When the QuickVoxelCore object is created, the VolumeCollection can be fetched to perform actions directly on it.

A instance of VolumeCollection manages and identifies Volume instances.
A `Volume` can be added to the collection using `.addVolumeFromUrl()` and `.addVolumeFromFile()`.
Once one of these two method is called, a `Volume` instance is created (itself generating a 3D texture)
and added to the collection with a given index.

VolumeCollection provides some events, so that actions can be triggered during the lifecycle of a `Volume`:

-   `volumeAdded` is called when the volume is parsed and added to the collection. But its webGL texture is not ready yet! The callbacks attached to this event will have the volume object as argument.
-   `volumeReady`called after `volumeAdded`, at the moment the added volume has its WegGL 3D texture ready. At this stage, a volume is ready to be displayed.The callbacks attached to this event will have the volume object as argument.
-   `volumeRemoved` is called when a volume is removed from the collection with the method `.removeVolume(id)`. The callbacks attached to this event will have the volume id (string) as argument.
-   `errorAddingVolume` is called when a volume failled to be added with `.addVolumeFromUrl()` and `.addVolumeFromFile()`. The callbacks attached to this event will have the url or the HTML5 File object as argument.

To each event can be attached multiple callbacks, they will simply be called successivelly in the order the were declared. To assiciate a callback function to an event, just do:

    myVolumeCollection.on("volumeReady", function(volume){
       // Do something with this volume
    })
